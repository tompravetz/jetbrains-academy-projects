# Simple Chat Bot

This is my first Python project built through JetBrains Academy. Itâ€™s a simple command-line chatbot that interacts with the user by:

- Asking for their name
- Guessing their age using remainders (Chinese Remainder Theorem)
- Counting up to a number
- Giving a small multiple-choice quiz

## Skills Demonstrated

- Input/output
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Modular code organization

## How to Run

```bash
python chatbot.py
```
