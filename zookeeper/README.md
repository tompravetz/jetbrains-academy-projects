# 🐾 Animal Habitat Viewer

This is one of my early Python projects from the JetBrains Academy curriculum. It simulates switching between "camera feeds" of different animal habitats using a simple CLI interface.

## 📚 Project Description

When the program runs, users are prompted to enter a number (0–5) to view an ASCII art representation of one of the animals:

- 0 – Camel 🐫
- 1 – Lion 🦁
- 2 – Deer 🦌
- 3 – Goose 🪿
- 4 – Bat 🦇
- 5 – Rabbit 🐰

Each habitat includes a small scripted description. Typing `exit` ends the simulation.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to store and access multiple multi-line strings
- How to work with lists and string indexing
- Loop and conditional handling for user interaction

## 💻 How to Run

```bash
python animal_viewer.py
```

Then follow the prompt to select a habitat or type exit to quit.

🔮 Future Possibilities
While this project is a static mockup, it lays the foundation for later improvements like:

Input validation

Real file I/O

Modular code structure

This project is part of my JetBrains Academy Projects collection, where I'm building up my foundational Python skills.
